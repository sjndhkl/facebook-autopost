===========================

Development Motivation: Just Needed Facebook Autopost :)

Wordpress Plugin to Auto Publish Posts into Facebook Page/Profile


Built with Wordpress 3.8, should work above WP 3.

Try it and don't forget to drop me a comment.


Instructions to follow:
==================================
Please note that only real personal Facebook accounts have permissions to create an App. Business accounts can't manage Facebook Apps.

1. Please go at this Url https://developers.facebook.com/apps 
and click on 'Create New App'.
Note: If you can't click on 'Create New App', you need first 
to 'Register as a developer'.
Then the creation of New App will be available.

2. Fill in your 'App Name' and click continue.

3. Enter the required Captcha Challenge.

4. Once on the basic settings of your new App, 
for the field 'App Domains' enter your blog domain name 
(example: mydomain.com)
In the field 'Website with facebook login' enter your blog Url.
(example: http://mydomain.com)
Sandbox mode should be disabled.
Save changes.

5. Copy your 'App ID' and 'App Secret' and configure your facebook account
in Facebook Autoposter Settings.

6. You will know what to do next :)
